name: Build and deploy dev env docker images to GHCR

# This workflow builds docker images that contain the development environment for the cotainr tool.
# NOTE: this workflow only runs on the main branch and branches starting with 'docker_dev_env'.
# The purpose is to be able to test cotainr on different apptainer/singularity versions both locally and via github actions.
# The general flow of the action is:
# 1. Prepare various inputs (container-inputs stage) for the builder (build-docker-images) & manifest creation (create-manifest) jobs.
# 2. Build the images (build-docker-images) for different architectures (arm64 and amd64).
# 3. Create a manifest that combines the two architectures (create-manifest).
# 4. Launch the CI_push workflow.
