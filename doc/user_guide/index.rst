User Guide
==========

The User Guide covers a basic introduction to `cotainr` (this page) along with separate in-depth pages describing :ref:`typical uses of cotainr <use_cases>`. See the :ref:`Getting Started <section_getting_started>` guide for information about installing `cotainr`.

.. _why_cotainr:

Why would I want to use `cotainr`?
----------------------------------
The two main reasons to use `cotainr` are:

1. It runs entirely in :ref:`user space <cotainr_technical_motivation>`, i.e. you don't need root/sudo privileges (or `fake them <https://apptainer.org/docs/user/1.0/fakeroot.html>`_) to use `cotainr`.
2. It makes it a lot easier to build `Singularity`_/`Apptainer`_ containers for certain :ref:`HPC use cases <use_cases>`.

In order to achieve this, the scope of `cotainr` is deliberately limited - focus is on making it easy to build reasonably performant containers for :ref:`common HPC use cases <use_cases>`. If you need a general purpose solution for building containers that achieve the absolute maximum performance, you should stick with `Apptainer`_/`Singularity`_ instead of `cotainr`.

.. _cotainr_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------
Since `cotainr` is a tool, written in `Python`_, for building `Singularity`_/`Apptainer`_ containers, you need the following to be able to use `cotainr`:

- A Linux OS (since `Singularity`_/`Apptainer`_ `only runs on Linux <https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html#installation-on-linux>`_)
- `Python`_ >=3.8
- `Singularity`_ >=3.7.4 [#]_ or `Apptainer`_ >=1.0.0

Additionally, some features provided by `cotainr` may impose requirements on the base images you use when building containers, e.g. when including a :ref:`conda environment <conda_environments>` the base container must have `bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ installed in it.

.. _command_line_interface:

Command line interface
----------------------
The primary way to use `cotainr` is via its command line interface. The `cotainr` command provides a :code:`--help` option that may be used to display all its options:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cotainr --help


Building a container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Containers are built using the :code:`cotainr build` subcommand, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cotainr build my_container.sif --base-image=docker://ubuntu:22.04

which would create the container `my_container.sif` based on the official `Ubuntu 22.04 DockerHub image <https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu>`_.
The same could be achieved with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cotainr build my_container.sif --system some-system

if the system :code:`some-system` was defined to use the same docker image.
These predefined systems can be listed with the info command, and will be defined by your system administrator to help you create containers.

Not specifying any further options to :code:`cotainr build` than above, provides no more than what can be achieved with a :code:`singularity pull`.
In order to add software and files to the container, you need to use the options available with :code:`cotainr build`.
To list all options, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cotainr build --help

Also, take a look at the :ref:`list of use cases <use_cases>` for further inspiration to building containers using `cotainr`.

.. _hpc_systems_information:

System information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make sure that everything is in your environment, you can run the :code:`cotainr info` subcommand.
This will provide you information about the system and also providing you with names of predefined systems.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cotainr info
    Dependency report
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Running python 3.10.8 >= 3.8.0, OK
        - Found singularity 3.8.7 >= 3.7.4, OK

    System info
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Available system configurations:
        - lumi-g
        - lumi-c


Python interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Power users may consider using the :ref:`cotainr Python API <section_api_reference>` as an alternative to the command line interface.


.. _use_cases:

Use cases
---------
Typical use cases, that `cotainr` makes very easy to handle, include:

- :ref:`Creating a container based on a Conda environment <conda_environments>`
